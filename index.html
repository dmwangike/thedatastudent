						<p>
							Bodaboda is a word used in East Africa to mean motorbike taxi services. This is a convenient and ubiquitous mode of transport especially in areas where other forms of commute are not viable. Besides that, it has enabled many young people to have a source of income with the high unemployment rate. Most Bodaboda riders acquire the motorbikes through micro-credit and asset financing. The case study presented is based on a fictitious Bodaboda SACCO, which lends to its members through asset financing.

						<p>As part of our class work as Data Science students we were taken through the MovieLens Case Study, which is based on data collected on movie fans, details of movies and the rating of the respective movies.  I took a tangent from the coursework, out of curiosity to try and find out, from the data provided, which genre pairs of the movies were most popular. Based on the assumption that people have a loyalty to certain genres, the insights from this review would help the Movie theatres determine which movies to screen.                                                                                        </p>

						<p>
							This project is about data visualization of geospatial data. I used data on Kenyan population census to plot the data on the map for the visualization.
							The project entailed some very basic data clean-up, such as data-type correction. But it demonstrates foundational knowledge on mapping similar data and visualizing it accordingly.

This includes ATMs, Point of Sales Services, Cards that enable online payments and purchase at different merchants among others. This project is a visualization of the spread of the various services and the depth (count) of usage in the different regions. This is on an aggregating map that breaks down the activities as you zoom in on a region.</p>

						<p>Bon Marche is a fictitious clothes seller with outlets all over Kenya. They deal in various clothing items including Males suits, Female suits, Shoes, dresses, Shirts and other clothing accessories. This is a visualization of their sales across the country. This is based on lessons learnt from Alex the Analyst on YouTube. I set a goal to learn Tableau over the Easter Holiday. This is my very first attempt to use Tableau in visualization. The display is in graphs and geospatial mapping </p>

							Whereas I have many years of experience in data analysis, especially using SQL, I prefer to think of myself as a data analysis student. This is because I am ever on the lookout for an opportunity to learn something new in data analysis.
							This webscraping exercise is based on Udemy course by Jose Portilla. The scraping exercise is on a website created specifically for this purpose. I undertook to scrape off three key items, Book Title, Its price and in-stock status.

						<p>Foodhub is a food delivery service similar to Uber Eats. It uses an application to facilitate orders between customers and eaterie joints. For the service it charges a commission based on the cost of the orders. It has accumulated some data on customer behavior and the process from the time food is ordered to when it is delivered.This project is an analysis of the given data to enable better service delivery and to advise marketing initiatives on the same. </p>

						<p>This is my code-along project for the IBM Data Science Course on Cousera. Whereas the course is free it has a very good depth on statistical concepts such as ANOVA, Pearson’s coefficient, model building, model testing. All this is based on the real-life data of the second hand vehicles giving one an industrial application of the given concepts and sufficient hands-on labs. Another advantage of this course is you get a Credly verifiable certificate after completion which you can proudly share on your social media.</p>
